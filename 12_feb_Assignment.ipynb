    "Ans 1:- In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an Exception occurs, the program execution is halted and the interpreter prints an error message along with a traceback that shows the exact location of the error in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur due to a variety of reasons such as invalid user input, network issues, file I/O errors, and so on. To handle Exceptions, Python provides a mechanism called Exception Handling, which allows the programmer to catch, handle and recover from Exceptions gracefully, without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Syntax errors are errors that occur due to incorrect syntax in the code. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter at the compile-time and prevent the program from being executed. Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, mismatched parentheses, incorrect indentation, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differences between Exceptions and Syntax errors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exceptions occur during program execution while Syntax errors occur during compilation of the code.\n",
    "* Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program while Syntax errors prevent the program from being executed.\n",
    "* Exceptions can be handled using Exception Handling while Syntax errors need to be fixed by correcting the syntax in the code."
